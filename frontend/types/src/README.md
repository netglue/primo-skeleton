# Custom Type Definitions

The PHP Files in this directory compile down to JSON in `../dist` and those files can be copy/pasted into the Prismic writing room as your custom types.

There's quite a bit here as the existing types are intended to work with the example repository.

Also, the php makes much use of the TypeBuilder class found in [netglue/prismic-cli](https://github.com/netglue/prismic-cli). You don't have to use this, but it helps to create valid document type definitions because your IDE will help you with type hints etc.

Icons for the slices use [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/) so pick one of those for your slices and you should be all good üëç
